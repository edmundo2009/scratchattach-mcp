
This is an excellent and comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) with a detailed implementation plan. The structure is logical, moving from high-level product goals to a concrete code foundation. The vision is clear, and the success metrics are specific and measurable.

I have reviewed the document and made revisions to enhance its clarity, robustness, and readiness for development. The changes focus on addressing potential risks, improving the core logic, and ensuring the architecture is truly extensible.

### Summary of Revisions
1.  **Added "Risks and Mitigation" Section:** A crucial part of any PRD, this section identifies potential challenges, primarily the limitations of the NLP parser, and suggests strategies to address them.
2.  **Refined Technical Requirements:** Added a requirement for the knowledge base to be easily updatable, as this is key to the system's extensibility.
3.  **Strengthened the `NaturalLanguageParser`:** Improved the sentence splitting logic to be more robust and added comments acknowledging the limitations of a regex-based approach, paving the way for future enhancements.
4.  **Improved the `BlockGenerator`:** The `_create_jump_sequence` was a critical but oversimplified pattern. I have expanded it to generate a complete, functional jump (up, wait, down), which better reflects a real user request and demonstrates how to handle compound actions.
5.  **Clarified Formatter Logic:** Added comments to the `PictoBloxFormatter` to clarify that it's a structural representation and that a full implementation requires a detailed mapping to the official project JSON specification.

Here is the revised and finalized document.

# Block Generation System - Product Requirements Document (Revised)

## Product Overview

### Vision
Transform natural language descriptions into executable Scratch programming blocks, making programming accessible to children through conversational interfaces.

### Success Metrics
-   **Accuracy**: 90%+ correct block generation for common requests.
-   **Coverage**: Handle 50+ common programming patterns.
-   **Speed**: Generate blocks within 2 seconds for typical requests.
-   **Usability**: Kids can successfully use and understand the generated code 95% of the time.

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Children (Ages 6-14)
-   "I want to make my cat walk across the screen"
-   "How do I make a sound when something is clicked?"
-   "Can you help me create a jumping character?"
-   "I want to make my sprite change colors forever"

### Secondary Users: Parents/Teachers
-   "Generate a simple animation project for beginners"
-   "Create blocks for teaching the concept of loops"
-   "Show me how to explain event handling in a simple way"

## Core Features

### 1. Natural Language Parser
**Input**: Free-form text descriptions.
**Output**: Structured intent objects.
**Examples**:
-   "make cat move right" → `{action: "move", direction: "right", subject: "sprite"}`
-   "when space pressed jump" → `{trigger: "key_press", key: "space", action: "jump"}`

### 2. Block Mapper
**Input**: Structured intents.
**Output**: Scratch block sequences.
**Features**:
-   Maps intents to specific Scratch blocks from a knowledge base.
-   Handles parameter substitution (e.g., number of steps, key to press).
-   Maintains logical block ordering and supports nesting (e.g., loops).

### 3. Output Formatter
**Input**: Block sequences.
**Output**: Multiple format options.
-   Human-readable, step-by-step instructions.
-   Scratch block JSON for programmatic use.
-   PictoBlox/SB3 compatible project format.

## System Architecture

```
Natural Language Input
         ↓
   Intent Parser (Rule-based, extensible to ML)
         ↓
   Pattern Matcher (Looks for complex actions like "jump")
         ↓
   Block Generator (Constructs blocks from intents/patterns)
         ↓
   Output Formatter (Generates text, JSON, etc.)
         ↓
Multiple Output Formats
```

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
-   **Response time**: <2 seconds for 90% of simple requests.
-   **Memory usage**: <100MB for loading the core knowledge base.
-   **Concurrent requests**: Support 10+ simultaneous users in its initial version.

### Reliability
-   Handle malformed or ambiguous input gracefully.
-   Provide fallback explanations or suggestions for unknown requests.
-   Maintain consistency across similar requests to build user trust.

### Extensibility
-   **Knowledge-Driven**: New block definitions and programming patterns must be addable by editing external JSON files, without changing the core code.
-   **Pluggable Outputs**: The architecture must allow for new output formats (e.g., SB3 Formatter) to be added easily.
-   Support for custom Scratch extensions can be added in the future.

## Risks and Mitigation

-   **Risk 1: NLP Brittleness**: The initial regex-based parser may fail with complex or creatively phrased sentences.
    -   **Mitigation**: Start with a rule-based system for a well-defined scope. Log unrecognized inputs to identify common patterns and improve the rules. Plan for a future iteration to integrate a more advanced NLP library (like spaCy) or a lightweight ML model for intent recognition.
-   **Risk 2: Scope Creep**: The number of possible Scratch patterns is vast.
    -   **Mitigation**: Focus on the 50 most common patterns identified through user research as the initial goal. Prioritize actions related to movement, events, looks, and sound.
