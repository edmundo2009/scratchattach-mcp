I have successfully created a comprehensive test suite for the scratchattach-mcp project and performed basic functional testing. Here's what was accomplished:

✅ Test Files Created
 tests/fixtures/sample_inputs.json - Test data with expected inputs and outputs for various scenarios
 tests/fixtures/expected_outputs.json - Expected outputs for different formatters and tools
 tests/test_parsers.py - 11 tests for natural language parsing functionality
 tests/test_block_generation.py - 15 tests for block generation system
 tests/test_formatters.py - 13 tests for text and PictoBlox formatters
 tests/test_mcp_integration.py - 17 tests for MCP server integration
✅ Test Results Summary
Total Tests: 56 tests - ALL PASSING ✅

Parser Tests: 11/11 passed ✅
Block Generation Tests: 15/15 passed ✅
Formatter Tests: 13/13 passed ✅
MCP Integration Tests: 17/17 passed ✅
✅ Test Coverage
The tests cover:

Core Functionality:

Natural language parsing (simple commands, complex commands, edge cases)
Block generation from intents (patterns, triggers, multiple intents)
Output formatting (text format, PictoBlox JSON format)
MCP tool integration (all tools working correctly)
Edge Cases:

Empty inputs
Unknown commands
Invalid formats
Error handling
Case insensitivity
Malformed inputs
Integration Testing:

Full pipeline from natural language → blocks → formatted output
MCP server initialization and tool availability
System status reporting
Authentication handling (with and without Scratch credentials)
✅ Functional Testing Results
The basic functional tests demonstrate:

✅ Block Generation: Successfully generates blocks for various inputs
✅ Multiple Output Formats: Text and PictoBlox formats working
✅ Concept Explanation: Educational explanations working correctly
✅ System Status: All components properly initialized
✅ Error Handling: Graceful handling of edge cases
✅ Key Features Verified
Knowledge Base Loading: Successfully loads 5 block categories and 9 patterns
Natural Language Processing: Correctly parses movement commands, triggers, and parameters
Block Generation: Creates appropriate Scratch blocks from parsed intents
Multiple Formatters: Text and PictoBlox output formats working
MCP Integration: All 6 MCP tools functioning correctly
Educational Features: Age-appropriate explanations for programming concepts
The test suite provides comprehensive coverage and validates that the scratchattach-mcp system is working correctly across all major components. The system successfully transforms natural language descriptions into Scratch programming blocks through a robust, data-driven architecture.
